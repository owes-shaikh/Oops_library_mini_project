## Library Management System

This is a basic Python program that simulates a Library Management System. It allows users to perform various library-related operations such as displaying available books, lending books, adding books, and returning books.

## Features

The program includes the following features:

1. Display Books: Users can see a list of all available books in the library.

2. Lend a Book: Users can borrow a book from the library. The system tracks who has borrowed the book.

3. Add a Book: Users can contribute new books to the library's collection.

4. Return a Book: Users can return a borrowed book to the library.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the script `library_management.py`.

2. You will be presented with a menu that allows you to choose from the available options.

3. Enter the number corresponding to your desired action (e.g., 1 for Display Books).

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the selected action (e.g., entering a book name or your name).

5. The program will provide feedback on the success or failure of the chosen action.

6. You can continue to interact with the library management system by choosing another action or quit by entering 'q'.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```
Welcome to the Public Library. Enter your choice to continue:
1. Display Books
2. Lend a Book
3. Add a Book
4. Return a Book
```

If you select option 1, it will display the list of available books. If you select option 2, you can lend a book and provide your name. Options 3 and 4 allow you to add a book or return a book, respectively.
